# PasswordGeneratorJW
I created a javascript external page. In the page i used a function called writePassword, created a var called characterEl with the capital and lowercase letters of the alphabet. also included symbols and numbers into the characterEl. createde a var called passwordlength that allows me to set how long i want the password to be. In my case it was 8. Created another var called password, which allows the password to be visibly generated on the website. After i created a for loop which enables the javsascript to select characters randomly, by using the Math.random  tag. Then created a getelementbyId for the password, and finished with an event listener when the button is clicked to generste the password. I finally added an onclick="writepassword()" into the html <button id = "generate" >tag.
